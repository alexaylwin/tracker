# Tracker 2

## About

Tracker is a simple app that lets users track the amount of time that they spend doing tasks. It allows for a configurable list of activities to track, records the durations that users engage in activities, and provides basic statisitics about past activity.

## Features

### Activity List - UNIMPLEMENTED
The activity list is a user-defined list of activities that users can track. 


### Activity Tracking
Activity tracking is achieved with a 'stop watch'. Users can select their current activity, click 'Start' to begin the activity and 'Stop' to finish the activity. The activity is automatically recorded as soon as 'Stop' is clicked. It will appear in their recent activity list immediately. 

### Activity Statistics - UNIMPLEMENTED
