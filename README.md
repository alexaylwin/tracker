# tracker
A simple activity tracker to record how much time is spent on different tasks. This was created as a sample project for learning Angular 2 and to gain experience with Typescript. It is largely based on the Angular 'Tour of Heroes' tutorial, found here:
[https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)

## Installation

```
npm install
```

	- Add seperate view for tracking all activities
	- Create server-side project (more than just activites.php)
		- Save activities to DB
